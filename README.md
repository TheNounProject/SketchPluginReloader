In cases where you would need to restart Sketch to refresh your plugin, Plugin Reloader will disable and enable the plugin to achieve the same result without restarting Sketch.

## How

1. Install the plugin
2. Select setup (reload will also work the first time)
3. Enter the identifier of the plugin you are developing and want to reload.
4. Select reload
